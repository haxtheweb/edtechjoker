# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

## Tues
- Start of Project 3. Understanding scope and requirements
- Time to work in class and finish up
- Project 2 due at Midnight

# Wed
- Generate questions surrounding scope for project 3

## Thursday
Today in class I'll be walking through how the repo for the project 3 boilerplate works. Here's the trade I just made with you all:

- I increased the requirements of all 3 projects beyond what I originally intended
- I improved the baseline / boilerplate to solve some of the complex issues up-front
- This will be a mix of design and JS state management
- Each of these can be thought of as a "full applicaation"
- You are encouraged to work together
- You still are submitting individually
- You are encouraged to borrow past work from my design system - https://haxapi.vercel.app/
- You are encouraged to borrow past work from this design system - https://shoelace.style/
- Discussion of the scope of each issue and possible ways of attacking them
