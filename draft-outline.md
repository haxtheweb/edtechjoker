# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Tutoring support on campus
TAs have office hours and we use time in class for help too, but https://ist.psu.edu/learning/tutoring/university-park is also available.
