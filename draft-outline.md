# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Tutoring support on campus
TAs have office hours and we use time in class for help too, but https://ist.psu.edu/learning/tutoring/university-park is also available.

# Past weeks
- [Week 1](sp26/week-1-2.md)

# HAX Club meeting Monday night 7pm
- come to a code sprint, work on things for ~2 hours
- get credit for the coding in the world aspect to the course
- bonus 2.5% in the class for making contributions (up to 5% bonus)
- **WESTGATE E202**

# Week 2 - The one with Git..and Github

## Day 2.1 - MLK

## Day 2.2
- Git lecture
- Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bfNIILQxz8giCLSszmdvDnfNDXY9fpcgYgc-cDE1fFQ/edit?usp=sharing
- Git activity in class

## Between class
- Watch this video of me solving a problem and the full end to end pipeline with github and process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc7sNh2Zisg
- **HW Part 1** listed below: do between class for discussion as well as jump starting the homework

## Day 2.3
- Slide deck which I will run through very quickly (you can read on your own time or use as basis to google concepts) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rbC4d-sXTyDUArLPXl-tBEQ8ZJldD9_QFfuFhgIW73g/edit?usp=sharing
- Live coding / paint by numbers: Let's make a button in codepen https://codepen.io/
 - I will model the button on the white board
 - I will start asking you to type the same thing I am so we are all on the same page
 - I will enhance the button to do different things
 - I want you to search for "In HTML, how do I make a link open in a new window"
 - This is effectively the way to learn how to build and interface with the small aspects of the language in order to understand how to build bigger things
- Starting into homework in class below as Part 2 (Part 1 you will do independently)

## Homework
Two-part homework this week; we will have time in class to start and then the focus will be critique via submissions generated by the class.

### HW Part 1
- https://www.w3schools.com/ -- Do the "Learn CSS" tutorials (all of them, this is mostly a primer and they go quick as you start to get them)
- Fork this pen on codepen https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/gOjGpam
- Try to make more than 1 meme by duplicating the HTML portion of the code
- Modify the text / image used in the meme on the HTML portion
- Try to modify the font-size using the CSS tab.
- Make a new HAX.PSU.EDU BLOG POST where you try to answer the following questions
  - Provide a Link to your fork of the codepen
  - Look at the CSS / styles; What's special about `--meme-maker-font-size-medium`?
  - Look at @media in styles() what does this do?
  - In the CSS area, write a selector for changing the font color on both tags. If you can change this, how did you do it? If  you can't, why don't you think it is working?

### Part 2:
- here's what I made in a previous class: https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/dyrWXBp
- Working with your pod, come up with an agreed upon visual as to how you'd conceive the following problem:
#### We need to make a card with a fancy button on it
- I will model the button on the white board
- I'll use codepen to create the button based on my model - https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/dyrWXBp
- You are free to follow along and copy or just watch and ingest technique

#### Now it's your turn, kicked up a notch
- Working with your Pod, created a shared model of a card visually based on the requirements below
- model things after the screenshot / pen and paper copy you came up with

#### Required steps:
- Create a new codepen from scratch and try to create a "card" using a mix of semantic, div and other tags to lay the card out:
- Create a simple “card” using a few SECTION or DIV tags, a Heading for the title, a Paragraph for description of the image an IMG for an image, and a button on the card that says "Details" which links to hax.psu.edu
- Make the image a fixed size via height / width and ensure the card is no bigger than 400px wide (height is weird in CSS, ignore height)
- Use the Border, Margin, and padding attributes in order to space the card to visually be appealing (the internet can help influence something to model, try making things 8px and then 12, then 16 to find what you like, ratios are key)
- Add a media query that only shows the details button when the screen is smaller than 800px (generally a small tablet) but larger than 500px (phone)
- Add a media query that scales the card (and image / items within) when on a screen smaller than 500px (generally considered phone)
- Create a new blog post on hax.psu.edu

#### Remediation
I will not verify you completing the assigned tutorials from HTML and CSS, but both are important to understand the fundamentals of the langauges and you'll ask less questions about it if you did them:
- https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
- https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/resources -- the resources section of the course site has links to free "books" which cover a lot of fundamentals as well

## Homework Submission
**Submit the link to your HAX.PSU BLOG POST in Canvas**
The HAX.PSU BLOG POST should include the following:
- A link to your code pen fork from Part 1 of the meme and part 2 of the "Card"
- Answers to the questions asked about part 1.
- If you found particular websites helpful from a tutorial perspective on any of these specific requirements, then include them so we can share with the class.
- If you have questioned unanswered / things you couldn't figure out from the "Card" activity, what are they?
- a picture of the mock up you were trying to model the card off of (YOU CAN UPLOAD VIA DRAG AND DROP OR BLOCKS TAB OR MERLIN MENU AT THE TOP OF THE UI)
