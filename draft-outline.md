# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Tutoring support on campus
TAs have office hours and we use time in class for help too, but https://ist.psu.edu/learning/tutoring/university-park is also available.

# Past weeks
- [Week 1 and 2](fa25/week-1-2.md)
- [Week 3](fa25/week-3.md)
- [Week 4](fa25/week-4.md)

# Week 6 - Streeeeetch time

This week we will learn the following by doing:
- build pipeline on vercel
- pull in existing resources (for sillies)
- using new tooling and starting on a counter-app

## 6.1 / 6.2 / 6.3
- a past card for review (no audio) if you need help resolving issues in yours
  - https://github.com/dylanabke/polaris-chip
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLHHVYR2CyI
- If you don't have a vercel.com account that is hooked up to github, please do this now.

### Class Activity

- ~30 min activity
- Let's wire our repo up to vercel (if you don't have vercel working bc of account lock, not end of the world; just watch w/ a partner)
- Now we have a build pipeline.
- We'll pull in an existing resource called meme-maker
- first we have to install it `npm install --save @haxtheweb/meme-maker`
- then we have to import the reference to the meme into our card just like the lit import `import "@haxtheweb/meme-maker/meme-maker.js";`
- Now we can leverage an implementation of the meme-maker tag in our card.
- https://haxtheweb.org/welcome/what-is-hax/meme-maker to see an example
- Add this meme to your card to replace the image you have by doing the following
- Get this working locally and then pushed up to github for vercel to rebuild
- You now have a pipeline end to end

# Counter App - Project for the week
- past recording (audio did not record :( ) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWJEjc2QR0
We are going to use a new tooling to start working on this project. This is the developer on-boarding tooling that I wrote for our HAX community.

- Open a terminal window, navigate to where you'd like to run it from (for me that's `~/Documents/git/btopro` but can be wherever you are storing your code)
- if you didn't run `npm install --global @haxtheweb/create` then do so, otherwise you should be able to just run `hax start`
- I will step through the CLI in class so you can see how it works though it is pretty straight forward
- We've created code, that is currently on our machine, in version control, but is NOT on github. Let's fix that.
- Open **github.com website**, create a **new empty project** with the same name `counter-app`
- Open **github desktop**. Add project and select `counter-app`. Push the code up to github.com

The rest of class is to start into this and ask questions of me / our TAs / each other. We'll also have time to work on Thursday. I've given you the wiring and process to start building things with web components. SO, now its your turn. Below are the requirements for the
homework this week. Discuss them with your pod, co-work, share research, and come up with how to best build the following:

# Counter App Requirements
- "Counter" is the most common demo repo in any project implementation because it illustrates simple "state management"
- Discuss with your people around you, just like how we started with the Card.

- What does the design look like (roughly)? What HTML / CSS requirements are there
- What properties should this have?
- Are there flexible HTML areas?
- Is there anything we have to worry about to ensure this remains "stateful"

### HTML / Demo
- Ideally there would be multiple in you `index.html` but only 2 instances are required.
- Each is a Web component so that we can get `<counter-app counter="16" min="10" max="25"></counter-app>` as for how the HTML is written
- 1 that has sane defaults so it "just works" with `<counter-app></counter-app>` and 1 with values supplied like above
- THIS IS NOT WITH ANY JAVASCRIPT IN THE INDEX.HTML FILE. ALL JS CODE AND LOGIC IS SELF CONTAINED TO THE WEB COMPONENT

### shadowRoot / render contents
- I just want to print the current `counter` number with 2 buttons below it. One that's `+` and one thats `-`
- When you click `+` I want it to increment counter but not go over max
- Same for `-` but I want it to decrease the counter and not go below the minimum
- This should shoot for the minimum amount of `html` tags required in order to generate a decent looking counter

### styles
- Use DDD for the following via CSS variables. You can read about these here: https://haxtheweb.org/documentation/ddd
  - example: `color: var(--ddd-theme-default-wonderPurple);` will get you the wonder purple color. Expand collapsible areas to see other CSS variables that you can leverage. DDD was made by a former IST 256 student as part of a semester independent study project!
- The number should be a rather large font size.
- the buttons should be next to each other but below the number
- the buttons should have focus / hover states
- when we hit 18 on the counter the color of the number should change
- when we hit 21 on the counter the color of the number should change
- when we hit min or max the color of the number should change
- apply spacing to buttons and elements to ensure they look reasonable (think golden ratio like multiples of 4, 8, 16)

### Logic
- When we hit min, disable the min button `?disabled="${this.min === this.counter}"`
- when we hit max, disable the max button
- when the counter hits 21, `makeItRain` by using the `updated(changedProperties)` lifeCycle method - https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/#updated

### Leveraging outside code
install outside code: `npm install @haxtheweb/multiple-choice --save`
use it to wrap the content you want to explode (probably the entire counter to be honest) - `<confetti-container id="confetti"></confetti-container>`
Here's some JS that can be used to make it rain confetti

```js

updated(changedProperties) {
  if (super.updated) {
    super.updated(changedProperties);
  }
  if (changedProperties.has('counter')) {
    // do your testing of the value and make it rain by calling makeItRain
  }
}

makeItRain() {
  // this is called a dynamic import. It means it won't import the code for confetti until this method is called
  // the .then() syntax after is because dynamic imports return a Promise object. Meaning the then() code
  // will only run AFTER the code is imported and available to us
  import("@haxtheweb/multiple-choice/lib/confetti-container.js").then(
    (module) => {
      // This is a minor timing 'hack'. We know the code library above will import prior to this running
      // The "set timeout 0" means "wait 1 microtask and run it on the next cycle.
      // this "hack" ensures the element has had time to process in the DOM so that when we set popped
      // it's listening for changes so it can react
      setTimeout(() => {
        // forcibly set the poppped attribute on something with id confetti
        // while I've said in general NOT to do this, the confetti container element will reset this
        // after the animation runs so it's a simple way to generate the effect over and over again
        this.shadowRoot.querySelector("#confetti").setAttribute("popped", "");
      }, 0);
    }
  );
}
```

## Homework
- Commit your solution to the above problem to your git repo
- go to vercel.com and connect this account to your github account / repo.
- If you do this, your project should automatically start building on vercel for a CI pipeline / demo space
- Turn in a link to your github repo and the link to your project working on vercel (should be like whatever.vercel.app as an address)
- **A link to github is turned into Cantvas**

### Considerations
- Do the best you can to provide the most complete solution you can
- We'll have discussions and in-class review to improve the quality of solutions
- Next week we'll remediate to improve solutions and ensure everyone stretches to the same level
- LAs will grade harshly based on requirements, but realize this is still only a few points. The more critical thing will be the feedback given as far as what's missing as opposed to real attempts that are broken
