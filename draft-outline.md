# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Tutoring support on campus
TAs have office hours and we use time in class for help too, but https://ist.psu.edu/learning/tutoring/university-park is also available.

# Week 11
Project 1 is due this weekend - https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2476

# 11.1

Examples to review
- Ok conceptually but AI, not loading data from the endpoint, not using DDD, but interesting solutions within - https://project-1-umber-pi.vercel.app/
- Decent data structure to review - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MamanMadaan/project-1/refs/heads/main/api/chefs.json
- Deep dive on this project, may want to pull down locally to load - https://github.com/DaGooseful/fox-app
  - missing `/api/` call for the json data
  - using DDD
  - really interesting way of handling "likes" data
  - clean up demo so there's less content in itt
  - resizing cards for sure
  - no hard coded image references
  - "fox by" alt data isn't perfect but not a terrible way of handling things

# 11.2
- Class is discussion time to answer some questions of each other and compare work

# 11.3
Open office hours

# Project 1 due
Project due Sunday

# Looking ahead
- Project 2 will actually be broken into several in-class oriented UX studies; starting to a UX study of the ice planner app you did as well as the photo loading project
- These UX studies will then segway into micro-projects, several of them
- This UX feedback will serve as the basis for doing work on HAX
- **This section will be heavily in-class discussion and explaining the code to write oriented**
