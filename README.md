# IST 256 - FA 2024
Welcome to the "web components are the future that is here right now" course. This course is for advanced Web application development and that could go one of two ways.
1. Industry way. Adopt whatever gets you an app quickly. You understand how nothing works, adopting whatever conventions someone blogs about
2. My way. We learn vanilla and use a very small library just above vanilla called Lit. If you can grasp the micro you can build macro.

Why?
- You'll know what makes up industry tools
- You'll have a broader perspective and still adopt tools but more inline with the right tool for the job (hopefully)
- You'll still learn HTML / CSS / JS but be closer to what their raw capabilities are as opposed to going right to abstraction and being lost
- You'll still learn a popular node based toolchain and how it plays nicely with version control and continuous integration systems
- I use these tools in my own projects, thus making you more able to contribute to them directly
- People taking my courses in the past have instantly gone into dev careers implementing web components because they are becoming a valid industry go to

# I need a book
If that's true. I suggest you read this. https://eloquentjavascript.net/ or http://Javascript.info
I won't quiz you on it but it's going to make life a lot more logical as we go through things like event loop and JS logic.

# I need courses / additional tutorials
I'd also question that you need a book in the age of AI, free online tutorials, and a mountain of resources from Google Code Labs to YouTube to Coursera. The web is made of the stuff we use to learn about it, so look there.

# How this class works - ALWAYS IN THE [draft-outline.md](draft-outline.md)
- You log into this repo, and go to the [draft-outline.md](draft-outline.md) file so that you can see what we are working on
- You follow along with tutorial and discussions in class
- You continue work beyond class, usually with external videos to watch, readings, code to write
- You blog about what you are doing and how it's going
- We work on these things more in class and openly review / critique code together

# Resources
- [common-issues.md](common-issues.md) is for.. common... issues. We all have them, especially when getting a pattern for learning down. To make my life more plesant and you to get answers faster, look through it before you have issues as we dig into code. It's a very repeatable feedback loop.
- https://lit.dev - I will assign things from the tutorial / playground there but its on you to get into documentation and better understand the library and how it impacts the web
- https://lit.dev/learn/ - different tutorials in video, written and playground form. Really great stuff here though a lot of it is a bit more advanced than how we'll be approaching Lit for development
- https://open-wc.org/ - OpenWC is the toolchain we're using, probably won't need this site but worth mentioning at least
