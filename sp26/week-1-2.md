# Week 1 - The one with getting started
## Day 1.1 - The one where we go through the contract
- Welcome and syllabus day. Take this quick survey - https://forms.gle/hpdTyW7cRNdySKQ28
- Context setting what we'll be working on, learning about and the industry at large as well as establishing what brought me from the classrooms you've taken to the stage where I am today and online
- This is a rare sit and listen day so you should be googling stuff and installing requirements for the class https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/requirements 

## Between class if possible
- https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/requirements - get accounts on these services
- Install the software mentioned and bring any issues you have to class
- *If you have issues with vercel, please contact their support as soon as possible. They take awhile to respond sometimes and it will enhance your ability to see 'built' work out at live web addresses when having it.*

## Day 1.2: Get basic structure around the big 3, fundamentals and playing with stuff
- We'll "hack" the penn state website and learn that the browser is the debugging environment
- Play with a very watered down "web application" called the "Stupid Simpsons App"
- Check out a code pen, a really easy way of learning HTML/CSS/JS by remixing examples of others
- https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/activities/day-1

## Day 1.3
- Explain what GitHub is just enough to get an account and see some projects
- Same for vercel
- Same for codepen
- Same for vscode with plugins
- Same with making a website on HAX.psu
- Same with installing HAX locally on your machine
- Need to get to the screen that says welcome to hax

Each step of the way it's like 5 minutes to walk through while they get an account and then answer any questions people have.

- Show an example submission of how we want things submitted this semester
- Then show the one submission made to canvas as the example of what is expected and that, in general, submissions will be made outside of canvas and then you'll link to them

## Homework
- https://www.w3schools.com/ -- Do the "Learn HTML" tutorials (all of them, this is mostly a primer and they go quick as you start to get them)
- Create an account on https://github.com 
- Create accounts on the services listed here: https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/requirements
- Create a **PUBLIC** Gist on https://gist.github.com/ called **week-1.md** (so that you can write markdown and practice doing so)
- Watch this video on terminal basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwTswuFkMH4 
- Read this [common issues document](common-issues.md) (and keep it in mind going forward as it'll save us time and time is valuable!):
- Watch the following video / have it open in another tab: https://youtu.be/DWvRV9KuTjk 
- Write responses using Markdown (Look it up if you don't know how to do it but bottom right corner in gist will have a `M^` button w/ details):
  - If the question is a simple answer / response. Then make it a HEADING using markdown for the question `## `
  - If the question has multiple responses (like 5 syntaxes) then make the question a HEADING level 2, but the responses using a bulleted list (look this up)
  - If you end up adding a code sample, use the ` ``` ` three back ticks syntax in order to show the code in a block.
- Questions to answer
  - Was the backend or frontend responsible for the bug in the video?
  - What languages do you see in this video? List ALL of them. If you're not sure what the language is, but you know there's an additional one, indicate that.
  - What tools, strategies, and workflows used in the video do you think are common across all web development?
  - What strategies used in the video help with debugging?
  - What strategies have you used before that are shown here for debugging?
  - What tools and approaches used in the video do you think help in quality control / quality assurance?
  - What are 5 syntaxes / pieces of code shown you DO recognize (could be of any scale or size), time stamp (link) or screenshot it and list what they are them. (screen shots can be drag and dropped into the comment area below your gist)
  - What are 5 syntaxes / pieces of code shown you DON'T recognize, time stamp (link) or screenshot it and list what they are them. (screen shots can be drag and dropped into the comment area below your gist)
  - You just wrote responses to these questions in Markdown. What even is that? (insert meme here :p). What is Markdown and how is it similar, different, or related to HTML?
  - What are 3 things you CAN NOT do in markdown that you CAN do in HTML?
