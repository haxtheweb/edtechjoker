# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

Web Components

Web Components are a set of standardized technologies that let developers create reusable, encapsulated custom elements in web applications. They use custom elements, shadow DOM, and HTML templates to ensure components work consistently across browsers. Theyâ€™re important because they allow developers to build modular code that is easier to maintain and reuse across projects.

Lit

Lit (formerly LitElement) is a lightweight JavaScript library for building fast, reusable Web Components. It simplifies creating components with declarative templates, reactive properties, and efficient DOM updates. Itâ€™s important because it makes building Web Components more developer-friendly while maintaining performance and standards compliance.

NPM

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the worldâ€™s largest software registry, used for managing JavaScript packages. It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects. Itâ€™s crucial because modern web development relies heavily on third-party libraries and tools that NPM makes accessible and easy to update.

Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript outside the browser. Itâ€™s used for building scalable backend services and tools. Itâ€™s important because it lets developers use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, unifying the web development stack.

JavaScript

JavaScript is the core programming language of the web, enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs in browsers, and with Node.js, it also powers servers. Itâ€™s important because nearly every modern website depends on JavaScript for interactivity, logic, and communication with servers.

Git

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate across teams. It allows branching, merging, and managing versions of projects. Itâ€™s important because it prevents code conflicts, helps manage project history, and enables collaboration on large projects.

HAXTheWeb

HAXTheWeb (HAX) is an open-source project that allows users to build and edit web content using Web Components without needing to code. Itâ€™s important because it democratizes web development, giving both developers and non-developers tools to create accessible and reusable content structures.

Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way to interact with your computer or tools by typing text commands instead of using a graphical interface. Itâ€™s important in web development because many tools (Git, NPM, Node.js, etc.) rely on CLI commands for installing packages, managing code, and deploying applications.
