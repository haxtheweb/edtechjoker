## Web Components
- Web Components are a collection of technologies that enable developers to create reusable custom elements with functionality encapsulated from the rest of the code, making them easy to use in web pages and applications. They are built on existing web standards and are being integrated into the HTML and DOM specifications, allowing developers to extend HTML with new elements that include encapsulated styling and custom behavior. Custom components and widgets created with Web Components work across modern browsers and are compatible with any JavaScript library or framework that supports HTML. Considered a major innovation in web development, Web Components act as building blocks of code that can be created once and reused in multiple applications or projects, promoting modular programming and making code easier to manage and maintain in the future.
