## Web Components

Web Components are a suite of standard web platform APIs that provide the opportunity to design production-quality custom, encapsulated, reusable components for the web. They are important simply because they support component-based architecture that simplifies the development and maintenance of complex web applications. The Shadow DOM allows you to write components that have their own separate styles and markup that won't conflict with other elements on the page. Highly modularized: Good modularity fosters code reusability, and developers can re-use the same modules to build custom elements just as native HTML tags.
