# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

## Web Components
Web Components are a suite of standardized browser APIs that enable developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements with their own functionality and styling.They're important because they allow developers to build framework-agnostic, modular UI elements that work across different projects without dependency conflicts.

## Lit
Lit is a lightweight library for building Web Components that simplifies the process of creating reactive custom elements with an elegant, declarative syntax.It's important for web development because it removes much of the boilerplate code required when working with vanilla Web Components

## NPM
Its the default package manager for Node.js and the world's largest software registry, hosting millions of reusable code packages. It's critically important for modern web development because it enables developers to install and manage project dependencies, leverage existing solutions, and share code across the global development community.

## Node.js
Node.js is essentially what runs JavaScript, It is what 'does' stuff within the file. It is a high performance, single-threaded event loop that is very popular for building modern web applications.It is also known for it's scalability and for having an extensive ecosystem:
*Event-Driven, non-blocking I/O = great for real time applications
*Collection of libraries making development easier

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that enables interactive and dynamic functionality on websites, running in web browsers and on servers through environments like Node.js. Its importance in web development is fundamental. It is one of the three core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS, and the only programming language that runs natively in all major web browsers.

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code and enables multiple developers to collaborate efficiently by managing different versions of files. It's fundamental to modern web development because it provides a complete project history, enables safe collaboration through branching and merging, and integrates with platforms like GitHub that add code review and continuous integration features.

## HAXTheWeb
HAXTheWeb is an open-source, web component-based content management and authoring system that enables users to create and edit web content using a block-based editor with a focus on accessibility and portability. It's important for web development, particularly in education, because it empowers non-technical users to create rich, accessible web content while developers can extend functionality through custom web components.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
A Command Line Interface is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer program, operating system, or development tool by typing commands into a terminal or console, rather than using graphical user interfaces.
