## Web Components

Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated HTML elements. These custom elements behave like standard HTML tags but are built with their own functionality, style, and structure. Web Components consist of three main technologies: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates. This approach promotes modular design, enhances maintainability, and improves code reuseâ€”key principles in modern web development. Web Components work natively in most modern browsers, reducing the need for third-party frameworks.
