## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

## NPM
Node Package Manager or NPM for short is where developers can find, create or build code packages. This can be especially useful for web development where developers have large amount of code and they can use the package manager to handle dependencies. npm is the world largest software registry and currently contains over 800,000 code packages. These packages are open source. [For more info click here](https://www.npmjs.com/) [or to learn how to use it click here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp)

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is essentially a simplified version of HTML. It is used to write in this GitHub file. You can use Markdown by using symbols and other elements to indicate what text is to be changed when formatted. Markdown is a more user-friendly method to format text as it has simple syntax and a smaller scale of stylistic options than HTML. Eventually, Markdown can be translated into HTML but requires an additional processor.

## IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is an application used to write, run, and test code. IDEs are used by programmers to develop software in an easy manner without having to risk ruining live versions of the code. Basic functions of an IDE usually include a source code editor, a build automation tool, and a debugger.

## PHP
PHP is an open source server-side scripting language which developers use. Server-side means that the script is being executed on the back-end instead of the front-end. PHP is mostly used for webservers and can also run on the command line. There are a lot of things that PHP can do, including: encrypting data,send and recieve cookies, generate dynamic page content, among others. Companies like Facebook, Wikipedia use PHP. Some advantages of PHP include:
* It's cross-platform, and thus can be used in any OS system
* It's an open source progamming language
* It's easy to learn

## Express.js
Express is a broad framework that's used to build web and mobile applications. More specifically, it's used for building RESTful APIs with Node.js. It is considered a standard server framework for Node.js. It was initially released on November 16, 2010.

## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and interacting with relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations such as querying data, updating records, creating and modifying database structures, and controlling access to the data. SQL is essential for tasks like retrieving specific data from large datasets, joining tables, and ensuring data integrity.

## MySQL
MySQL is an open source database that uses Structured Query Language as its query language. It allows one to store, manage, and retrieve data that is organized in tables.

## Docker
Think of Docker like a special box filled with building blocks, the kind you'd use to make awesome stuff like houses, cars, or robots. You know how building things is fun, but redoing them exactly the same way can be a bit of a chore? Well, Docker comes to the rescue! It's like a super-efficient building block organizer. You can store all the specific blocks you need in this virtual box, and when you want to build something again, Docker helps you put them all together effortlessly.

Now, picture programmers using Docker as a magical tool to build software apps. It's like a secret weapon that simplifies the whole process – creating, launching, and managing apps becomes a breeze. Just like your building blocks make creating things more enjoyable, Docker makes the lives of programmers easier by letting them focus on making amazing software without all the usual complications.

This is how you create a new docker image :)

```docker build -t <image_name> .```


## Vagrant
Vagrant is an open-source software tool used to build and maintain virtual software development environments, which are built upon virtual machines (e.g. VirtualBox). The tool provides a simplistic command-line client to manage said environents, along with an interpreter for text-based definitions of each environment's appearance via Vagrantfiles. This makes it easier to create local environments that mimic the environment your code will be deployed and ran on, which is important for making code compatible across several types of devices with different operating system. Vagrant is written in the Ruby programming language. Some of the basic terminologies related to Vagrant include:
- Box: A packaged Vagrant environment (aka virtual machine)
- Provider: The location where the virtual environment runs (locally, remotely, etc.)
- Provisioner: A tool of any complexity established by the virtual environment

## VirtualBox
Oracle VM VirtualBox is cross-platform virtualization software. It allows users to extend their existing computer to run multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris, at the same time.


## Composer


## Kubernetes / K8s
Kubernetes is an open source system to automate tasks for container management, which is a way to bundle up the application to decomplicate it. Kubernetes allows us to run systems with little to no downtime, by doing the following tasks:
- Load balancing
- Automation
- Scaling
It can also be used for other tasks related to containers.

## Apache Web server
Also known as an Apache HTTP Server, an Apache web server is an open-source software that essentially helps websites accesible on the internet

When someone submits a request to a web server for access to a website, Apache is the software running on that server. It looks at the request, finds the right files (like HTML pages, images, videos etc.), and sends them to their browser.

## Webpack
Webpack is a static module bundling tool that was mostly designed for Jacascript, but is also works for HTML and CSS. Webpack is a tool the bundles pieces of code and their dependencies together into one file or multiple files by procesing the application and creating a dependency graph.  Webpack is a free and open source tool that can be used to efficinetly enhance workflows and the performance of web applications.
