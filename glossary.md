## PHP
PHP is an open source server-side scripting language which developers use. Server-side means that the script is being executed on the back-end instead of the front-end. PHP is mostly used for webservers and can also run on the command line. There are a lot of things that PHP can do, including: encrypting data,send and recieve cookies, generate dynamic page content, among others. Companies like Facebook, Wikipedia use PHP. Some advantages of PHP include:
* It's cross-platform, and thus can be used in any OS system
* It's an open source progamming language
* It's easy to learn

## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and interacting with relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations such as querying data, updating records, creating and modifying database structures, and controlling access to the data. SQL is essential for tasks like retrieving specific data from large datasets, joining tables, and ensuring data integrity.

## MySQL
MySQL is an open source database that uses Structured Query Language as its query language. It allows one to store, manage, and retrieve data that is organized in tables.

## Docker
Think of Docker like a special box filled with building blocks, the kind you'd use to make awesome stuff like houses, cars, or robots. You know how building things is fun, but redoing them exactly the same way can be a bit of a chore? Well, Docker comes to the rescue! It's like a super-efficient building block organizer. You can store all the specific blocks you need in this virtual box, and when you want to build something again, Docker helps you put them all together effortlessly.

Now, picture programmers using Docker as a magical tool to build software apps. It's like a secret weapon that simplifies the whole process – creating, launching, and managing apps becomes a breeze. Just like your building blocks make creating things more enjoyable, Docker makes the lives of programmers easier by letting them focus on making amazing software without all the usual complications.

This is how you create a new docker image :)

```docker build -t <image_name> .```


## Vagrant
Vagrant is an open-source software tool used to build and maintain virtual software development environments, which are built upon virtual machines (e.g. VirtualBox). The tool provides a simplistic command-line client to manage said environents, along with an interpreter for text-based definitions of each environment's appearance via Vagrantfiles. This makes it easier to create local environments that mimic the environment your code will be deployed and ran on, which is important for making code compatible across several types of devices with different operating system. Vagrant is written in the Ruby programming language. Some of the basic terminologies related to Vagrant include:
- Box: A packaged Vagrant environment (aka virtual machine)
- Provider: The location where the virtual environment runs (locally, remotely, etc.)
- Provisioner: A tool of any complexity established by the virtual environment

## VirtualBox
Oracle VM VirtualBox is cross-platform virtualization software. It allows users to extend their existing computer to run multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris, at the same time.


## Composer


## Kubernetes / K8s
Kubernetes is an open source system to automate tasks for container management, which is a way to bundle up the application to decomplicate it. Kubernetes allows us to run systems with little to no downtime, by doing the following tasks:
- Load balancing
- Automation
- Scaling
It can also be used for other tasks related to containers.

## Apache Web server
Also known as an Apache HTTP Server, an Apache web server is an open-source software that essentially helps websites accesible on the internet

When someone submits a request to a web server for access to a website, Apache is the software running on that server. It looks at the request, finds the right files (like HTML pages, images, videos etc.), and sends them to their browser.

## PaaS
(Platform as a Service) 
PaaS (Platform as a Service), as the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

## SaaS
Saas stands for Software as a Service and is a way for applications to be accessed over the internet
(Software as a Service) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis.
