# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

## Web Components
Web Components are a set of native web standards that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements using browser APIs rather than frameworks. They are composed of technologies like Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates, which together enable components that manage their own structure, style, and behavior. Web Components are important because they are framework-agnostic, meaning the same component can be used in plain HTML, React, Vue, or Angular, making them ideal for design systems, shared UI libraries, and long-term maintainability.

## Lit
Lit is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies building Web Components by adding reactivity, declarative templating, and efficient rendering. Built directly on web standards, Lit reduces the boilerplate required when working with Custom Elements and Shadow DOM while preserving their benefits. Lit is important for web development because it provides a framework-like developer experience without framework lock-in, making it a popular choice for scalable design systems and cross-framework component libraries.

## NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js and the largest ecosystem of open-source JavaScript libraries in the world. It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies needed for web applications, such as frameworks, build tools, and utilities. NPM is essential to modern web development because it enables modular development, speeds up workflows, and supports collaboration by standardizing how dependencies are distributed and versioned.

## Node.js
Node.js is essentially what runs JavaScript, It is what 'does' stuff within the file. It is a high performance, single-threaded event loop that is very popular for building modern web applications.It is also known for it's scalability and for having an extensive ecosystem:
*Event-Driven, non-blocking I/O = great for real time applications
*Collection of libraries making development easier

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that runs in the browser and on servers (via Node.js) to create interactive, dynamic web experiences. It enables functionality such as form validation, animations, API calls, and real-time updates, forming one of the three core web technologies alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is critical to web development because it powers client-side interactivity, modern frameworks, and full-stack applications.

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, experiment safely, and revert to previous versions when needed. It enables branching, merging, and collaborative workflows used by teams of all sizes. Git is important for web development because it provides code history, collaboration, and stability, and it underpins platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## HAXTheWeb
HAXTheWeb is an open-source ecosystem and authoring framework focused on creating content and web experiences using Web Components and modern web standards. It emphasizes accessibility, reusability, and user empowerment by allowing both developers and non-developers to build structured content visually. HAXTheWeb is important because it demonstrates how Web Components can be used beyond UI widgets—supporting authoring systems, design systems, and educational platforms.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer program, operating system, or development tool by typing commands into a terminal or console, rather than using graphical user interfaces.
