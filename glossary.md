## Web Components
-Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code and utilize them in your web apps. Web components are important because they allow the creation of reusable, self-contained, and encapsulated custom HTML elements for web development. This function promotes code reusability within different frameworks and project. This can enhance development efficiency and maintainability. Web components also leverage browser features, leading to lighter-weight applications with potentially smaller bundle sizes and faster performance.
