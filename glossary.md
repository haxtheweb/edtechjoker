## NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is primarily a package manager for JavaScript, used in Node.js environments. While you cannot directly "run" npm within an HTML file, you can leverage npm to manage and integrate JavaScript packages that enhance the functionality of your HTML pages.

NPM allows you to install and manage JavaScript libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, jQuery, Lodash) that you then use in your frontend web development. These libraries are downloaded into a node_modules directory in your project.
