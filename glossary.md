## Web Components
Web Components are a set of standardized technologies that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated HTML elements. They consist of Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates, enabling you to build UI components that work across frameworks and browsers. This modular approach improves maintainability and scalability in large web applications.

Lit is built on top of Web Components standards, making it ideal for modern, framework-agnostic development. Its small size and performance optimizations make it a favorite for building design systems and UI libraries.
