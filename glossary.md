# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

Web Components are a set of standardized technologies that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements. They consist of three main parts: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates. These components help reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and enable interoperability across frameworks. They're especially useful in design systems and large-scale applications where modularity is key.
