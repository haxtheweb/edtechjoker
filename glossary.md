## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

## NPM
Node Package Manager or NPM for short is where developers can find, create or build code packages. This can be especially useful for web development where developers have large amount of code and they can use the package manager to handle dependencies. npm is the world largest software registry and currently contains over 800,000 code packages. These packages are open source. [For more info click here](https://www.npmjs.com/) [or to learn how to use it click here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp)

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is essentially a simplified version of HTML. It is used to write in this GitHub file. You can use Markdown by using symbols and other elements to indicate what text is to be changed when formatted. Markdown is a more user-friendly method to format text as it has simple syntax and a smaller scale of stylistic options than HTML. Eventually, Markdown can be translated into HTML but requires an additional processor.

## Docker
Think of Docker like a special box filled with building blocks, the kind you'd use to make awesome stuff like houses, cars, or robots. You know how building things is fun, but redoing them exactly the same way can be a bit of a chore? Well, Docker comes to the rescue! It's like a super-efficient building block organizer. You can store all the specific blocks you need in this virtual box, and when you want to build something again, Docker helps you put them all together effortlessly.

Now, picture programmers using Docker as a magical tool to build software apps. It's like a secret weapon that simplifies the whole process – creating, launching, and managing apps becomes a breeze. Just like your building blocks make creating things more enjoyable, Docker makes the lives of programmers easier by letting them focus on making amazing software without all the usual complications.
