# 8.1 - @ HAX Club 7pm 121 Ag Engineering building
- There is a guest lecture Monday night simply titled: "With the right tools, you can build anything"
- For this lecture, you are asked to have devices away, a notebook and pen, and to listen with an open mind. Write down anything that strikes you are interesting or questions you have while listening.
- After the talk, you are welcome to hang out and develop with HAX Club / ask questions.
- For evidence of attending the event, submit your notes to the Canvas dropbox **Code Sprint / Community Coding engagement 1**

# 8.2 - Sharing work in class
- Working with other people in your pod, explain to the person next to you how your code works, then do the reverse and write down the following reflection:
  - Any interesting design considerations they used with the input fields
  - How are each of you using events to manage inputs and updating data statefully?
  - Have either been able to implement the "state from URL" enhancement mentioend but not shown last class. If not, how do you plan on implementing this?
  - Anything with state management that differ in how you are solving the problem
  - Any issues / gaps in each project and work left to be done
- After reflecting on these questions, start working together to research and implement the issues discovered. Call over for help if needed from me and the LAs.
- **Turning in your reflection to Teams during class will get you attendence credit for the day. Turn this in at noon and the LAs will mark attendence based on participation**

# 8.3 - Working day
- Last day to work in class and ask questions
- Make sure you have all the functionality in the requirements to the best of your ability
- the app is due Sunday prior to midnight - https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2359
- Submit a link to your github / vercel.app link (for reviewing the working demo) to the Canvas dropbox by Midnight Sunday

# Looking ahead to 9
- We're going to build upon this app to incorporate Array based data
- We're going to loop over Array based data to visualize input as a table
- We're going to load data from a 3rd party service using `fetch` and load it into the same Array of data to visualize results
- This enhanced version of your app will be due next week
